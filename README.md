Most importantly that I am not resending all actions but listen store updates and send it to another redux instance which updates itself. 

Some diff algorithm can implemented on top of it.

It can be used in webworkers or on servers to relief client from costly computations.

Syncing can be used for realtime collaboration apps.

# TODO
- extract code from example to src
- publish npm 
- add doc
- add demo build script
